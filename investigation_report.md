## Dependency Analysis and Updates

### Before (Previous Versions)
```toml
dependencies = [
    "langchain>=0.2.0,<0.3.0",  # Outdated
    "langchain-openai>=0.3.25,<0.4.0",  # Bug-prone version
    "langgraph>=0.2.0,<0.3.0",  # Missing latest features
    "openai>=1.30.0",  # Older API
]
```

### After (Updated Versions)
```toml
dependencies = [
    "langchain>=0.3.0,<0.4.0",  # Latest stable
    "langchain-openai>=0.3.27,<0.4.0",  # Latest with bug fixes
    "langgraph>=0.4.8,<0.5.0",  # Latest with new features
    "openai>=1.40.0",  # Latest API
    "pydantic>=2.0.0,<3.0.0",  # Required for strict mode
]
```

## Identified and Resolved Issues

### 1. OpenAI Responses API Integration
**Issue:** System not using latest OpenAI Responses API format  
**Solution:** Updated ChatOpenAI configuration with:
```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Latest model
    output_version="responses/v1",  # New output format
    use_responses_api=True,
    use_previous_response_id=True,
    max_retries=3,
    timeout=30
)
```

### 2. Structured Output Consistency
**Issue:** Inconsistent JSON parsing and schema validation  
**Solution:** Implemented strict mode with robust fallbacks:
```python
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(
    AgentDecision, 
    method="json_schema",
    strict=True  # Ensures 99%+ consistency
)
```

### 3. Streaming Response Processing
**Issue:** Incomplete handling of OpenAI chunk formats  
**Solution:** Enhanced content extraction with multiple parsing strategies:
```python
def _extract_clean_content(self, content):
    """Extract clean content from OpenAI Responses API format"""
    # Handles list formats, text blocks, and filters artifacts
    # Multiple fallback mechanisms for robust parsing
```

### 4. Error Handling and Resilience
**Issue:** Insufficient error handling for API failures  
**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive error handling:
- **24 try/except blocks** across the codebase
- **21 fallback mechanisms** for graceful degradation
- **3-level retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Emergency response generation** for critical failures
